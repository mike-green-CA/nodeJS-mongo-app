# nodeJS-mongo-app
This is the app we made in our Back-End Web Development with Node.JS course! it uses a local Mongo Api we populate to display API data.

A little context on the API so on my computer inside of 
C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\Test Land\nodeJS_project\nodeJS_project
I have a file called coursesJson.js

and when I creat my mongoDB API I use that file to populate it
